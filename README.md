Quiz - Flask Session example
============================

This is a quiz application containing 5 questions that the user has to answer
to complete the quiz. The current question which the user has to answer is
saved and tracked using a session variable so that user cannot go back or ahead
without answering some questions.

When the user completes the quiz, a success message is shown and even on refresh
the same page is shown as the completion of the quiz is saved and tracked using
session variables.
